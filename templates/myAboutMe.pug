        p
          | I am Jeonghoon Kim, preferably 
          strong Ken 
          | from South Korea.
          | I am a senior majoring in computer science at the U of M and expected to graduate in Spring 2023 (next semester).
        p
          | I have been learning computer science since 2016 and started with Java but my major language is python.
          | I am learning programming because I can do so many things with it.
          | One of my interests is machine learning and deep learning I can analyze the data to predict something.
          | Before I join the army in 2018, I started web programming myself. I have learned HTML, CSS, and scratched JS
          | I have experienced a little bit of front-end and back-end.
          | I built an online shopping website, and API to learn what the backend is.
        p
          | If I have to build something, I would like to build a website that represents me, so this assignment is fairly what I wanted to do.
          | I enjoy playing soccer and swimming for staying healthy since many university students have bad eating habits and do not exercise due to school loads.
          | My favorite activity over the summer is surfing, which I did during the summer vacation in my home country.
        p
          | I love learning ML and DL and want to become a 
          em data scientist 
          | , but I am also considering 
          em web-developer 
          | and 
          em app developer 
          | due to high demands in the job market.
          | Therefore, this course might help me find what I really want to do after graduation, which makes me so excited!!!
